I'm a data-driven software engineer with a unique background. After years of working in customer service and a stint as a stay-at-home-mom, I decided to make a career-change and pursue engineering. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on creating the SRS for my next project, a family manager app 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning and practicing data mapping, and SQL and ETL tools
- :mag: I'm looking for a new opportunity as a full stack or backend developer, with interest in customer facing roles as well!
